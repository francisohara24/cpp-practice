/*
    Conclusions:
    1. When a struct is declared on the stack, the address of the struct is the same as the
       address of the first member of the struct. However, when a struct is declared on the heap, the address of
       the struct is not the same as the address of the first member of the struct.
    2. Heap memory addresses allocated using malloc are allocated in increments of 8 or 16 bytes (system dependent) regardless"
       of the type of variable the addresses are allocated for.
       For example, if memory is allocated for a char followed by an int using malloc, the memory allocated for the char
       will have an address 8 or 16 bytes from the address of the memory allocated for the int.
    3. Memory allocation on the heap is done in forward order from the earliest allocated memory addresses to the latest allocated memory addresses.
       This is the opposite of what is done on the stack where memory is allocated for variables in reverse order from
       the latest declared variable to the earliest declared variable.
    4. Structs perform byte alignment on their member variables regardless of whether they are stored on the stack or on the heap.
       Memory is allocated for struct members in increments of the size of the largest type within the struct.
